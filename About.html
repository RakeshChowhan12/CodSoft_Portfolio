    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Rakesh Chowhan, a passionate web developer and creative enthusiast with a keen eye for detail.<br><br>
      I specialize in crafting engaging and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life.<br><br>
      My journey in technology started with a love for problem-solving and grew into a profession that combines <br><br>
      logic with creativity.

      I am skilled in tools and technologies likeHTML, CSS and modern frameworks. <br><br><br>
      Whether I’m building a sleek portfolio, an educational site, or an interactive project like my ongoing <br><br>
      Solar System Website, I strive to deliver seamless and visually appealing experiences.<br><br>

      Beyond coding, I’m a content creator.<br><br>
      I run two YouTube channels:<br><br>
      - Tech Tutorials:Exploring technology reviews, AI tools, and educational how-to videos.<br><br><br>
      - Lyricsin_nature:Celebrating Bollywood songs, Bhakti music, and entertainment in harmony with nature.<br><br>

      When I’m not coding or creating, you’ll find me enjoying photography, music, and exploring creative ways <br><br>
      to merge technology with art.<br><br>

      I’m always open to collaborating on innovative projects or sharing ideas.<br><br>
       Let’s connect and create something extraordinary!<br><br>
